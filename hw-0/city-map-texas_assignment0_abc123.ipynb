The only goal of the virus is to spread to all cities in Texas. Find a possible way for the virus to spread (Uninformed Search).\n","*   To counter the effect of the virus, vaccine needs to be distributed to all cities. One city has more demand than supply, whereas one city has a shortage of vaccines. The goal is to find an **optimal** strategy to transport the vaccine (Informed Search) from the city with high supply (low demand) to the city with low supply (high demand).\n","\n","The base structure and comments are provided on what should be done.
